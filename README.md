# Note:
To succesfully run automation with Cypress I was unable to use the URL provided(https://codepen.io/CalendlyQA/full/KKPQLmV) as Codepen has introduced Captcha which blocks Cypress from performing automation against the site.  I copied the exact code used and hosted it on https://jsfiddle.net/sbajus/be054c26/ for the automated portion of the exercise.
